FuzzyJump is a Vim plugin to jump the cursor where you want like a pointing
device such as a mouse.  This plugin maps most of keys on a keyboard to
relative positions in the current buffer.  For example. if your screen looks
like:

	|if where git &>/dev/null; then                       |
	|  function prompt-git-head-name() {                  |
	|    if ! [ -d .git ]; then                           |
	|      return 1                                       |
	|    fi                                               |
	|    local head_name                                  |
	|    head_name="$(git branch | sed -e 's/^\* //;t;d')"|
	|"foo.sh" [New file]                                  |
	+-----------------------------------------------------+

then the correspondences of keys and positions are as follow (where {X} means
that key "X" is corresponding to the position where it is written).

	+-----------------------------------------------------+
	|{1}wh{2} g{3}&>{4}v/{5}l;{6}en{7}  {8}  {9}  {0}  {-}|
	|  function prompt-git-head-name() {                  |
	|{q} i{w} [{e} .{r} ]{t}he{y}  {u}  {i}  {o}  {p}  {@}|
	|      return 1                                       |
        |{a} f{s}  {d}  {f}  {g}  {h}  {j}  {k}  {l}  {;}  {:}|
	|    local head_name                                  |
	|{z} h{x}_n{c}="{v}it{b}an{n}| {m} -{,}s/{.} /{/};d{\}|
	|"foo.sh" [New file]                                  |

By default, this plugin defined 2-stroke key mappings to jump to one of the
above positions.  The key mappings consist of the common prefix ";" (which can
be customized to any key sequence; see |<Plug>(fuzzyjump-prefix)|) and one of
the above keys.  For example, if you type ";1", the cursor will move to the
position near {1} in the above figure.  For some keys such as {9}, there is no
text and it's not possible to move the cursor to the position, if so, this
plugin moves the cursor to one of the most useful positions near the specified
position.

Note that the original author doesn't consider about keyboard layouts other
than JIS layout.  So the above figure and the default key mappings are
somewhat strange for non-Japanese users.

* I'm using japanese layout keyboard, so I don't know how does it work in other layout keyboard.
